### Solution
We solved this problem by using [ML.Net's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/time-series-demand-forecasting) "TimeSeries" library along with the [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/) to make a program that runs during stock trading hours buying and selling stocks based on the results from a ML model.
