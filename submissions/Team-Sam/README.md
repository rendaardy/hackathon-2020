## Team ML.NET to the moon and back!

### Idea
We thought it would be fun to create a desktop app so a user can capture, label, train, and evaluate his or her object detection model. 

### Team contact

### Solution
We solved this problem by pretty much copying the wpf example from https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/tree/master/samples/csharp/end-to-end-apps/ObjectDetection-Onnx

There is still much to do, but I learned a lot from working through the code and envisioning future use case scenarios.
